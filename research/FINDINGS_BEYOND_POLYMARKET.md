# Findings: Beyond Polymarket — High-Yield Automated Strategy Search

Objective: find a fully-automated strategy clearing **10%+/month** (~120-200%+ APR),
accessible from Romania (EU), with disclosed drawdown/blowup risk. Prior work
(different branch/run) validated a Hyperliquid funding-basis trade at only
~5-7% net APR — too low for this objective's bar, not re-litigated here.

Stop condition: write `research/DEPLOY_THIS.md` only when a thread clears
**>5%/month net EV** (the objective's minimum bar; note the ask is 10%+/month,
so 5% net is a floor, not a target) with automation + geo-accessibility +
quantified drawdown all satisfied.

Threads are investigated in the priority order given in the objective, skipping
ahead only when a thread is cleanly dead/infeasible.

## Thread A: Crypto options premium selling (Deribit) — **DEAD (as tested: naive weekly short OTM puts)**

**Script:** `research/options_premium_scan.py`
**Data:** 100% real, live-pulled from Deribit public REST — no synthetic inputs.
- DVOL (Deribit's official implied-vol index) history, 12h candles, ~196 days back
  (`get_volatility_index_data`).
- Daily BTC-PERPETUAL / ETH-PERPETUAL close price, same window
  (`get_tradingview_chart_data`).
- Live order-book + real Greeks for a currently-listed ~7-10 DTE put, pulled to
  sanity-check the model against an actual tradable quote (`get_order_book`).

**Method (disclosed limitation):** Deribit's public API does not expose
historical option order-book snapshots, so the 6-month backtest is a
Black-Scholes *simulation*: real historical spot + real historical DVOL (ATM
IV) are fed into BS to price a put at the strike that model-implies a target
delta (5/10/20-delta tested); the strategy is rolled weekly (7-day hold); the
*actual* historical spot 7 days later (also real) determines assignment and
P&L. Real IV skew (OTM puts trade above ATM IV) is NOT modeled, which likely
makes the simulated premiums somewhat conservative (understated) vs. what a
real 10-delta put would have actually paid — but does not change the
fat-tail-loss dynamic that killed this thread (see below).

### Results (27 weekly rolls, ~2026-01 through 2026-07)

| ccy | delta | n | win rate | avg weekly return (on collateral) | ~monthly (additive) | worst single week |
|-----|-------|---|----------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| BTC | 0.05  | 27 | 92.6% | -0.23% | -1.0% | -5.5% |
| BTC | 0.10  | 27 | 88.9% | -0.18% | -0.8% | -7.1% |
| BTC | 0.20  | 27 | 70.4% | -0.26% | -1.1% | -8.8% |
| ETH | 0.05  | 27 | 92.6% | -0.46% | -2.0% | -13.0% |
| ETH | 0.10  | 27 | 81.5% | -0.39% | -1.7% | -15.2% |
| ETH | 0.20  | 27 | 70.4% | -0.43% | -1.9% | -17.4% |

**Every configuration is net-negative on average**, despite high win rates
(70-93%). This is the textbook short-vol trap the objective explicitly warned
about: two sharp weekly BTC drawdowns in the sample (week of 2026-01-25,
spot -13%; week of 2026-05-31, spot -13%) each wiped out 20+ weeks of collected
premium in a single event. High win rate does not imply positive expectancy
when the loss tail is fat and uncapped (short puts have max loss = strike,
i.e. can lose far more than the premium collected in a single bad week).

**IV rank right now (live, not backtested):** BTC = 15th percentile
(current 38.9% vs. 196-day range [34.4%, 82.6%]); ETH = 8th percentile
(current 52.5% vs. [47.7%, 95.8%]). The strategy's own logic (objective's
Thread A thesis) says to sell premium when IV rank is *high*, not low — **IV is
currently near 6-month lows for both coins, meaning this is a bad time to
initiate this trade even if the historical net-negative result weren't
disqualifying on its own.**

**Live cross-check:** current 10-delta-ish quotes exist and are tradable —
BTC-10JUL26-59000-P (delta -0.090, mark IV 45.0%, spot 63,403) and
ETH-10JUL26-1625-P (delta -0.094, mark IV 62.7%, spot 1,792) — so the
instrument/liquidity side of this thread is not the problem; the strategy's
risk/reward itself is.

**Verdict:** DEAD as a naive/unhedged weekly OTM-put-selling strategy over the
tested 6-month window. Not retested with: higher delta targets beyond 20,
IV-rank-gated entry (only sell when rank > 70th percentile), stop-losses, or
put spreads (defined max loss) — those would be reasonable follow-ups if this
thread is revisited, but the core finding (short-vol strategies blow up on fat
left tails that erase months of premium in one week) is unlikely to flip sign
with those variants; at best they trade some upside for a smaller, still-real
tail.

**Automation score:** high — Deribit has full REST + WebSocket trading API,
no geo-block encountered (public endpoints all responded normally from this
session). Not pursued further since the underlying strategy is dead.

**Next thread:** B (leveraged Hyperliquid funding basis) — not yet investigated
this run.
